/**
 * \brief A representer for vtkUnstructuredGrid using Procrustes alignment to align the datasets
 *
 * This class provides a specialization of the Representer for the type vtkUnstructuredGrid.
 * Procrustes is used to align the given datasets with the reference.
 * The user can choose between Rigid, Similarity and Affine alignment.
 *
 * Hint: In order to use GPA alignment, simply set the Procrustes Mean as the reference.
 *
 * Warning: This class does currently not provide any registration, which implies
 * that the dataset that are read by the class need to be aligned.
 *
 * See Representer for more details about representer classes
